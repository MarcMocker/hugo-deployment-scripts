# Hugo deployment scripts
:toc:

This project has it's origin in some quick and dirty scripts
I wrote to roll out changes made on https://gohugo.io[hugo]
websites in a quick and uncomplicated way.

## Main idea

The main idea is to run the `deploy.sh` in a linux container,
or any other kind of Debian server and to let it setup the
hugo site completely without the need to touch the container again.

## Usage

Simply run:

    wget https://github.com/MarcMocker/hugo-deployment-scripts/raw/main/deploy.sh | bash deploy.sh

in the cli of the container.

The script is going to ask you for the upstream repository with the hugo project (`clone` > `SSH`)
and guides you through any further steps if necessary.

Works even with private repositorys.

## Continous delivery

Moreover the script sets up a crontab (in `etc/crontab`) to check every two minutes for changes on
the upstream repository and rebuilds the site if necessary.

## Usecase

If your server is located behind a proxy and hidden from outside by a
firewall and Github actions cannot reach it. Else Github actions might
be more suitable and less resource intense for you.
